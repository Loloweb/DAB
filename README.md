# DAB
Short exercise on the recreation of a program based on its compiled state (reverse-engineering?)

Back in 2018 during my high school years, I made whats probably one of my first programs in C which was a proof of concept of an ATM script. Unfortunately, the only thing i've managed to back up of this was the compiled program, not the source code.
In 2022, for an assignment in English class, I decided to remake the source code myself in 24 hours and present it to the class. Its imperfect state meant i could add comments and suggestions on how to improve it myself, hence why I "rushed" it.

DAB is french for ATM and has nothing to do with the 2015 dance move.
